      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Carson, a student from Greensburg, IN, studying Software Engineering at Rose-Hulman
        Institute of Technology</p>
      <p>In my time at Rose I have worked on several projects such as an Arcade Game based off of Jetpac, an
        interactive Python Pokemon Database, and the website you're currently on!</p>
      <p>Outside of class, I lead a committee of students for Student Activities Board. We furnish SABâ€™s social media
        accounts with photography and promotional materials.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am always interested in connecting with people and working on new projects.</p>
      <p>View my <a href="/resume.html">Resume</a> or explore my <a href="/portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> to see
        my work, or feel free to get in touch</p>
